## Concept
Nothing beat the sensation to roll a real dice, but you don’t always have them in your hands, thinking about this, there are several applications and websites that roll dices. The **Fire Dice Roller** aims to facilitate some rolls to speed up some actions within the RPG, as well as to facilitate the life of the Master with the implementation of the option to save different rolls with different types of dices, for example, you can save all rolls of a monster that you will use in your campaign, so perform all the rolls at once, without having to consult the support material.

## Technologies Used

The application was created using *React-Native* with the *Expo* framework, in addition to the technologies present in the *React (Hooks and Redux)* framework, *React-Navigation Drawer and StackNavigator v5* was used for navigation between screens, for storage of the scrolls on the device, *Expo SQLite* was used to create the scroll database. The *Modalize* library was used to create the scroll modals.
